## Pseudo Classes

Styles are great for laying out a design but they
also play a much more important role, the role of
interaction. Using pseudo selectors we can provide
the much needed visual feedback to the user
about their use of the interface they are provided
with.

## Pseudo Elemens

* CSS pseudo elements allow for much more then simple styling. We can add content to the view based on some interaction.
